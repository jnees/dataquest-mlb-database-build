Build a relational database of baseball stats from CSV using SQLite3

This is my work on a project assignment from DataQuest.io. The goal is to build a relational database from csv files found on [Retrosheet.org](www.retrosheet.org) containing stats on over 171,000 major league baseball games dating back to the 1870's.

The actual starting csv file and final database are too large for upload on GitHub, but the python notebook outlines the steps taken to build offline.
